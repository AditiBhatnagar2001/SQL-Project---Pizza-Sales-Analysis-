# SQL Project-Pizza Sales Analysis 
In this project, we analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer key business questions provided by the client.

# INTRODUCTION<br>
In this project, we analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer key business questions provided by
the client.<br>
To understand the relationship between the data, a data model (ER Diagram) was created using
Power BI, which helped in defining proper table relationships and ensuring accurate analysis.<br>
All client questions were solved using SQL queries, applying basic and intermediate concepts such
as joins, group by, aggregate functions, and limit.<br>
Each question includes a business insight to help convert raw data into meaningful information.<br>
The overall goal of this project is to support business decision-making by providing clear insights and
answers related to sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends.<br>

# TABLES<br>
The dataset consists of four relational tables, which store information related to orders, pizzas, pizza
types, and order details.<br>

# CLIENT REQUIREMENTS<br>

Retrieve the total number of orders placed.<br>
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.<br>
Identify the highest-priced pizza.<br>
Identify the most common pizza size ordered.<br>
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.<br>
Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.<br>
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.<br>
Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.<br>
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.<br>
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.<br>
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.<br>
Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.<br>
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.<br>

The attached PDF contains the solutions to the above questions using SQL.

# BUSINESS INSIGHTS

High Demand Periods: Pizza orders rise sharply during midday and evening hours.
(Derived from: Distribution of orders by hour of the day)<br>
Strong Categories: Classic and Supreme pizzas perform better in terms of revenue.
(Derived from: Category-wise distribution of pizzas & Total quantity by category)<br>
Preferred Sizes: Medium and Large pizzas are ordered more frequently than other sizes.
(Derived from: Most common pizza size ordered)<br>
Sales Growth Pattern: Revenue shows a steady upward trend over time.
(Derived from: Cumulative revenue generated over time)<br>
Revenue Drivers: Certain pizzas generate higher revenue than others.
(Derived from: Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue & Revenue contribution analysis)<br>


# RECOMMENDATIONS
Focus marketing and promotions on top-selling and high-revenue pizzas.<br>
Ensure sufficient stock and ingredients during peak order hours.<br>
Popular pizza sizes should be prioritized in inventory planning.<br>
Promote premium pizzas to increase average order value.<br>
Improve or bundle low-performing pizzas with popular items to boost sales.<br>
Use revenue trends to forecast demand and plan future strategies.<br>
