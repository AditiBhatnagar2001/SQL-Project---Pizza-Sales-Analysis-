# SQL Project-Pizza Sales Analysis 
In this project, we analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer key business questions provided by the client.

# INTRODUCTION
In this project, we analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer key business questions provided by
the client.
The dataset consists of four relational tables, which store information related to orders, pizzas, pizza
types, and order details.
To understand the relationship between the data, a data model (ER Diagram) was created using
Power BI, which helped in defining proper table relationships and ensuring accurate analysis.
All client questions were solved using SQL queries, applying basic and intermediate concepts such
as joins, group by, aggregate functions, and limit.
Each question includes a business insight to help convert raw data into meaningful information.
The overall goal of this project is to support business decision-making by providing clear insights and
answers related to sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends.
